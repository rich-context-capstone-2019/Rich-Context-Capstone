We examine the heritability of psychological
resilience among US adults aged 25 to 74
years. Using monozygotic and same sex dizygotic
twin pairs from the National Survey of Mid-Life
Development in the United States (MIDUS) we
show that positive affect is equally heritable among
men (h2 = .60) and women (h2 = .59). We then esti-
mate the heritability of positive affect after
controlling for an exhaustive list of social and inter-
personal stressors, and we operationalize the
residual for positive affect as resilience. According
to this specification, the heritability of resilience is
higher among men (h2 = .52) compared to women
(h2 = .38). We show that self-acceptance is one of
the most important aspects of psychological func-
tioning that accounts for the heritability of resilience
among both men and women. However, compared
to women, men appear to derive additional benefits
from environmental mastery that may enable other-
wise sex-neutral resilient tendencies to manifest.
Two individuals who have experienced comparable
events throughout most of their lives may respond
very differently to the same stressful life event such as
a divorce, loss of a job, or the death of a loved one.
Those who successfully navigate these adversities and
report little to no adverse mental health consequences
are often characterized as resilient. Resiliency is
understood as a general, rather than domain specific,
orientation (Rutter, 2003), `implying a relative resis-
tance to environmental risk experiences, or the
overcoming of stress or adversity' (Rutter, 2006, p. 1).
Previous research has identified several sources of
resiliency with a particular emphasis on psychologi-
cal, material, and social resources available to
individuals (Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1997). However,
more recent findings suggest that genetic factors are
also important for understanding individual differ-
ences in resilience (Rutter, 2003; Silberg et al., 2001).
For example, Caspi et al. (2003) show a strong asso-
ciation between the number of stressful life events
that adults have experienced and their subsequent risk
of major depression. However, among those individu-
als with two long alleles of a gene responsible for
serotonin transmission (5-HTT) there is no clear
association between chronic exposure to stressful life
events and poor mental health. That is, individuals
who are homozygous for this allele are particularly
resilient to stressors that may otherwise lead to a
major depressive episode.
Few have examined the possibility that the genetic
effects on resilience may be different for men and
women. This is particularly relevant to the study of
gene­environment interactions because sex may con-
strain the genetic expression of resiliency among
women, and it may enable this potential among men
(Shanahan & Hofer, 2005). In their review of
gene­environment interaction studies, Shanahan and
Hofer (2005) argue that environments can `control
phenotypes despite genetic propensities to the con-
trary' but they can also `help actualize genetic
potential' (Shanahan & Hofer, 2005, p. 70). Within
the gene-environment interaction literature, the `envi-
ronment' is defined as narrowly as nutritional intake
(Allen & Farell, 1996) and as broadly as birth cohorts
(Kendler et al., 2000). And despite the fact men and
women are socialized differently, engage in different
roles in life, and have differential access to social and
material resources, sex is not typically considered as
an `environmental' moderator within behavioral
genetic research (for exceptions see Walters, 2002).
Because of the distinct environments in which men
and women (on average) are socialized, we argue that
biological sex, as a proxy for these different environ-
ments, enables genetically oriented resilience among
men and restricts these same genetic tendencies
among women. This understanding may explain why
others have demonstrated that the heritability of
depression as a function of prior stressors is roughly
30% among girls, but nonevident among adolescent
boys (Silberg et al. 1999). Similar results are also
reported in a recent study by Kendler and colleagues
(2006) who, using data on over 15,000 adult twin
pairs, calculate significantly different heritability

Sex Differences in the Heritability of Resilience
estimates for major depression among men (h2 = .29)
and women (h2 = .42).
Aspects of psychological functioning that are
thought to underpin ability to effectively cope are
often implicated in research of resiliency to childhood
adversity, and sex differences have been noted. Women
have been shown to have lower self-confidence, lower
self-esteem, and lower self-efficacy compared to men
(Costa et al., 2001; Feingold, 1994; Kling et al., 1999;
Lynn & Martin, 1997). Pearlin and Schooler (1978)
evaluated the efficacy of different psychological
resources and active coping responses in mediating four
role-based stressors. They find that men are equipped
with more psychological resources (e.g., self-esteem and
mastery) than women, concluding that in addition to
other unmeasured factors, socialization better equips
men with effective psychological resources, buffering
them from the otherwise deleterious impact of stressors
on wellbeing.
Interestingly, although previous work demonstrates
significant sex differences in psychological wellbeing,
there is less evidence that these factors are differentially
heritable. Kessler et al. (2004) assess six aspects of psy-
chological wellbeing including autonomy, mastery,
personal growth, positive social relations, purpose in
life, and self-acceptance. These authors demonstrate a
sizable heritable component for each of these factors,
ranging from .11 to .43, and there is very little evidence
that these factors are differentially heritable for men
and women.1 The differential availability of these
resources as a consequence of gendered experience,
may translate to other important aspects of mental
health. That is, if there is a latent orientation toward
resilience that has genetic underpinnings, then access to
psychological resources, especially those related to
sense of mastery, agency, and worth, may provide the
requisite foundation to enable resilience (Shanahan &
Hofer, 2005). Thus, sex may indirectly affect the struc-
ture of the genetic etiology of general resilience through
the provision of these gendered social psychological
resources.
In this article we examine the possibility that
resilience is a heritable trait among adults, and we
look for evidence of resilience above and beyond other
indicators of psychological wellbeing. Further, most
resilience research has focused on resiliency to child-
hood stressors and has devoted scant attention to
resiliency to environmental stressors during adult-
hood. We build on this literature by including
life-stressors that are more germane to adult popula-
tions, including problematic work environments or
troubled relationships with spouses or children, and
we examine the possibility that resilience is highly her-
itable among men, but only weakly among women.
Methods
This study makes use of data from the National
Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS), 1995­1996 (Brim et al., 1996). MIDUS is a
nationally representative survey designed to study the
effects of midlife development on the self-reported
physical health, psychological wellbeing, and social
consciousness of adults aged 25 to 75. Data in the
survey were collected through the use of a telephone
interview and a questionnaire mailed to nearly 7000
respondents. The MIDUS Twin Screening Project was
used to identify 998 adult twin pairs to participate in
the study. After a screening of roughly 50,000 house-
holds via a telephone interview, MIDUS interviewers
contacted the respondent who was then asked to
contact their twin to participate in the study.
Of the 998 pairs, we used data from same sex
pairs with a determined zygosity. There were 367
pairs of monozygotic (MZ), and 352 pairs of dizygotic
(DZ) twins included in the MIDUS study. We dropped
263 pairs of opposite sex DZ twins and 16 pairs of
undetermined zygosity. Because of the possibility of
population stratification, we further dropped non-
white pairs (n = 45) and pairs with missing race data
(n = 44), leaving 630 white pairs.2 We use only twin
pairs where both twins are not missing on the positive
affect measures, and impute missing values of covari-
ates for 78 pairs (a maximum of two imputations per
person), using the impute command in STATA 9
(StataCorps, 2005). In total our sample includes 527
twin pairs [male: MZ (n =129), DZ (n = 104); female
MZ (n = 155), DZ (n = 139)].
Measures
Resilience
We operationalize resilience as a positive affect despite
chronic exposure to stressful life events. We use a pos-
itive affect scale (Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998) created by
averaging responses from six items. Respondents were
asked `During the past 30 days, how much of the time
did you feel ... Cheerful? In good spirits? Extremely
happy? Calm and peaceful? Satisfied? Full of life?'
Responses were coded on a scale of 1 (All the time) to
5 (None of the time); the items were then standardized
and summed, such that higher scores indicate better
mood (Chronbach's alpha [] = .91). Descriptive sta-
tistics for all variables used in the analyses are
presented in Table 1.
Chronic and Acute Stressors
Role-based stress is measured with three scales
gauging the strain associated with one's spouse, chil-
dren, and parents. These scales were constructed from
a checklist of ten problems experienced by the respon-
dent in each respective role. The `yes' responses were
summed to yield possible scale scores between 0 and
10, with higher scores indicating more strain. We used
the spousal strain scale to classify married or part-
nered individuals into high strain and low strain
categories. Those in the 70th percentile (those with
two or more strains) were classified as high strain. We
also coded those without a spouse or partner as either
never married or widowed/divorced/separated, using a
set of dummy variables to model spousal strain and

marriage status. The child strain scale is treated as
continuous, giving those without children a score of
zero. We included a dummy variable for whether or
not respondents have children, to allow for the possi-
bility that having children can be beneficial to
wellbeing. Parental strain is treated as continuous;
those without parents were given a zero on the scale.
Respondents with a spouse, child, or parent, but
missing all ten items for the respective scale, were
given a missing value on the scale. Reliability coeffi-
cients are not reported for these scales, as the items do
not reflect an underlying construct; rather, they are
believed to represent the cumulative effects of inde-
pendent stressors. Scale questions, response sets, and
reliability coefficients, when appropriate, appear in
Appendix A.
In addition to role-based stressors, we included
measures of work-related strain (Bosma & Marmot,
1997; Karasek et al., 1981; Karasek & Theorell,
1990; Schwartz et al., 1988). The job strain measure
assesses the skill discretion, work demands, and the
authority one has over decisions; the job support
measure reflects the support one receives from
coworkers and supervisors. Those unemployed or out
of the labor force are given a zero on the standardized
scales, and a dummy variable was included to indicate
whether or not the respondent was employed. We
included measures of strain from family and friends
(Schuster et al., 1990; Whalen & Lachman, 2000),
financial strain, poor health status, perceived neigh-
borhood quality (Keyes, 1998), childhood SES, and
two demographic characteristics: age and education,
which were dummy coded as high school diploma or
less, and some college or more. To better capture the
impact of stressful life events, chronic stressors, and
acute stressors, we also include measures for social
support including perceived support from friends, and
support from their place of employment.
Psychological Functioning
The literature on life events, stress, and wellbeing indi-
cates that genetically oriented vulnerability may
operate through endophenotypic characteristics such
as self-esteem or sense of mastery (Kessler et al., 1992;
Kendler et al., 1998; McGuffin et al., 1996; Tennant,
2002). Support for this perspective is evident in the
fact that personality traits such as extraversion and
neuroticism are consistently associated with happi-
ness, positive affect, and subjective well-being (Costa,
et al., 1980; DeNeve & Cooper, 1998; Emmons &
Diener, 1985; Hills & Argyle, 2001; Pavot et al.,
1990). Accordingly, we define psychological function-
ing as traits that describe cognitive or behavioral
dispositions to see oneself in a particular way. We
posit that these resources condition one's response to
stressors, and may partially explain resilience to stres-
sors. We use the following six measures of positive
psychological functioning : (a) positive relations with
others ( = .58); (b) self-acceptance ( = .59); (c)
autonomy ( = .48); (d) personal growth ( = .55); (e)

Twin Research and Human Genetics February 2008
Sex Differences in the Heritability of Resilience
twins (twin differentiation assumption), can increase
or decrease concordance among twins as a function of
zygosity, respectively. Violations of these assumptions
can yield inaccurate heritability estimates. Others have
found violations of the equal environment assump-
tion, but not the twin differentiation assumption,
using the same data (Kessler et al., 2004). To adjust
for these concerns, we included statistical controls for
three questions about the similarity of respondents'
childhood experiences; these questions assess how
often twins were dressed alike, placed in the same
classrooms, and had the same playmates.
Results
DeFries-Fulker regression estimates are presented in
Table 2. According to these estimates (Models 1 and
3), positive affect is highly heritable, and there are no
observable differences in this estimate for men (h2 =
.60) and women (h2 = .59). Models 2 and 4 include
controls for sociodemographic characteristics, social
support mechanisms, and an exhaustive list of role
strains and social stressors. These controls signifi-
cantly improved model fit for both men and women
(r2
men
= .32; r2
women
= .39). Support derived from friends
and family is strongly associated with positive affect
and negative health status -- one of the most impor-
tant stress factors in the current literature (Ensel &
Lin, 1991), and deleterious for both men and women.
We operationalize resilience as the change in the heri-
tability estimate for positive affect with the inclusion
of these controls. That is, those who report high posi-
tive affect above and beyond this list of stressors and
life strains are operationalized as resilient.
Importantly, the heritability estimate for women
decreases (h2 = .38), whereas the same estimate for
men only reduces slightly (h2 = .52).4 Thus, we find
evidence that resilience is a heritable characteristic,
but more so among men compared to women.5
As discussed above, we expect the heritability of
resilience to be moderated by psychosocial factors that
facilitate adjustment to psychological stressors, and we
further anticipate the mediating role of psychological
functioning to be different for men and women. The
estimates presented in Tables 3 and 4 present a series of
DF models in which controls for psychological func-
tioning are included individually and we pay particular
attention to changes in the heritability estimate. The
first entry (model 1) of Table 3 is identical to model 2
of Table 2, but we only present the quantitative genetic
estimates to focus on the heritability estimate. Model 2
of Table 3 includes a control for positive relations with
others. Among men, this control reduced the heritabil-
ity estimate from .51 to .48, corresponding to a 6%
reduction in the estimate. The full array of covariates
reduced the heritability estimate for resilience for men
to 27%, and the effect was no longer statistically sig-
nificant. Table 4 presents the same analysis among
women, and tests of the mediator effects of psycholog-
ical resources are summarized in Table 5. Among men,
environmental mastery ( = .52); and (f) purpose in
life ( = .36; Ryff, 1989; Ryff & Keyes, 1995).
Statistical Analysis
We use a DeFries-Fulker (DF) regression technique to
estimate the relative contribution of genetic factors to
the demonstration of resilience (DeFries & Fulker,
1985). The estimates from this model are used to cal-
culate the proportion of variance for a particular trait
due to (1) genetic characteristics (broad sense heri-
tability); (2) shared environment; and (3) unshared
environment. In this model the value for the first twin
of pair j (y
1j
) is modeled as a function of their co-
twin's score on that same attribute (y
2j
), a measure of
zygosity (g
j
) coded .5 for MZ twins and 0 for DZ
twins, and an interaction between their sibling's score
and their zygosity (g
j
y
2j
).3 The estimate for b3 is oper-
ationalized as the proportion of phenotypic variance
due to genetic factors (broad sense heritability). This
estimate simply describes the degree of resemblance
among twins as a function of their zygosity. Because
the original DF model was designed around a proband
design, we use a double-entry structure and standard
errors are adjusted accordingly.

This model is particularly useful for our purposes
because it allows for control variables in addition to
the three covariates included in model 1. Because we
are interested in the heritability of resilience, we model
salutary affect, but also include an exhaustive list of
chronic and lifetime stressors and social and demo-
graphic characteristics that are known correlates of
positive affect. We operationalize the residual variance
in positive mood -- that is, after adjusting for life
stressors -- as resilience. Therefore, whereas the esti-
mate for b3 in equation 1 describes the heritability of
positive affect, the same estimate in equation 2 --
after controls for k stress-related or protective factors
-- denotes the heritability of resilience.

The heritability of resilience can be further decom-
posed as a function of factors that are theoretically
linked to resilience. As described above, there are
established aspects of psychological functioning that
may bear on an individual's resilience. Therefore, we
estimate one final set of models in which we include
an array of controls for psychological functioning. As
with the transition from equation 1 to equation 2, we
are primarily concerned with changes in the heritabil-
ity estimate with the inclusion of these variables.
Because we hypothesize differential effects by sex, we
estimate separate models for men and women.
The logic of quantitative genetic twin analysis
assumes that MZ and DZ twins experience similar
shared environments. Violations of this assumption,
resulting from MZ twins being treated more similarly
(equal environments assumption), or from MZ twins
attempting to differentiate themselves more than DZ

the only psychological resource that significantly
impacted the heritability measure was environmental
mastery. Although the heritability of resilience among
men remained statistically significant, this one item
explained nearly 40 per cent of the effect; this mediat-
ing effect was statistically significant. Environmental
Mastery consists of three questions that evaluate one's
appraisal of their ability to meet external demands and
responsibilities. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the ability to
maintain a sense of empowerment and competency, and
a positive view of oneself in the face of psychosocial
stressors appears to constitute a substantial portion of

psychological resiliency for men. Further, while this
reduction was only marginally significant (p < .09),
controls for self-acceptance reduced the heritability of
resilience estimate among men by 33%. Taken together,
these two aspects of psychological wellbeing appear to
be largely responsible for the realization of genetic ten-
dencies to be relatively resilient.
Although the magnitude of the heritability estimate
is notably smaller, similar analyses were performed for
women and are presented in Table 4. As with men,
the full array of psychological resources reduced the
heritability estimate to nonsignificance for women
(h2 = .04). Most of this reduction appears to be
linked with one particular psychological resource,
self-acceptance. This one control reduced the heri-
tability estimate by over 70 per cent, and rendered the
heritability of resilience statistically nonsignificant.
This was not the case for any of the single measures of
psychological resources among men.
Discussion
The key finding of this article is that resilience, as
operationalized here, is a heritable feature. More
importantly, the heritability of resilience is higher
among men compared to women. Including controls
for psychological functioning reduced the heritability
estimates for both men and women. This implies that
genetic factors -- mediated through more proximate
measures of psychological functioning -- play an
important role in heritable resilience to environmental
stressors. Self-acceptance appears to be an important
mechanism through which resilience manifests for
both men and women. While environmental mastery
emerged as an important factor responsible for the
heritability of resilience among men, this factor was
significantly less important among women.
Though sex may capture physiological differences,
such as hormonal or sex-linked genetic differences,
sex also confers different, broadly defined environ-
ments for men and women. Our findings are
particularly relevant to gene­environment interaction
studies because they suggest that sex is an important
environmental moderator of latent genetic factors
that contribute to salutary mental health. This point
is made clear when one considers that the two mea-
sures of psychological functioning that appear to
underlie the heritability of resilience (self-acceptance
and environmental mastery) are themselves highly
heritable, but they are not differentially heritable for
men and women. According to Kessler et al. (2004),
the heritability of self-acceptance and environmental
mastery are .41 and .33, respectively. When these
models were modified to allow a sex-specific esti-
mate, the inclusion of this additional parameter
estimate did not improve the overall model fit. Thus,
there is no evidence that either self-acceptance or
environmental mastery is differentially heritable
among men and women.

Twin Research and Human Genetics February 2008
Sex Differences in the Heritability of Resilience
to stressors involving friends and family due to their
social roles as caregivers. For example, Kendler et al.,
(2001) show that, compared to men, women are no
more susceptible to stressful life events in general.
However, they show clear differences in sensitivity to
specific life events including divorce, housing prob-
lems, and relationship conflicts. Many of the strains
and supports included in our models were interper-
sonal in nature, assessing one's role as a spouse,
parent, child, or employee; the relationship-oriented
variables witnessed the most differences among men
and women. Further, the relationship strains only con-
sider problems experienced by a spouse, child, parent
or interpersonal relationships among friends and
family. If women are more sensitive to the problems of
friends, these models may not specify these sources of
stress, acting to make female twins more discordant
and reducing heritability estimates for women.
A second possibility is that women use different
coping strategies than men. Our analysis considers
psychological functioning, but not repertoires of
coping strategies. A number of studies document dif-
ferences in the coping styles of men and women, with
many noting a more active style among men compared
to women (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978; Nolen-
Hoeksema, 1987). Notably, active styles have been
found to be more protective against the ill-effects of
stressors (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). Nolen-Hoeksema
This is important because it suggests that the medi-
ating role of psychological functioning -- as a
determinant of sex differences in the genetic effects of
resilience -- is social rather than biological in origin.
That is, it appears as though men are better able to
`cash in' on this genetically oriented resource.
Accounting for this phenomenon goes beyond the
scope of this paper, but it is likely that men have
greater opportunity to express resilience and are more
likely to be rewarded for exhibiting traditional signs
of resilience. In other words, gender socialization may
interact with genetic factors to either diminish
resilience for women, or help men to actualize some
genetic potential that confers resilience. We cannot
establish which of these two possibilities may be the
case. Genes only influence phenotypes within an envi-
ronment; to determine whether resilience is suppressed
or actualized would require us to assume that some
are socialized without clear gender roles, and this is a
difficult assumption to justify.
One explanation for the better prediction of a
female's positive affect may be that women are social-
ized to be relationship-oriented, while men are
socialized to be independent. Under the `cost of
caring' hypothesis, women are thought to be more
sensitive to the problems faced by their friends and
family (Kessler & McLeod, 1984; Maciejewski et al.,
2001). If this is this case, women may be less resilient

Jason D. Boardman, Casey L. Blalock, and Tanya M. M. Button
(1987) proposes that women are more likely than men
to ruminate over problems, whereas men typically dis-
tract themselves physically or instrumentally.
Importantly, ruminative coping styles have been shown
to lengthen depressive episodes (Kuehner &Weber,
1999; Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). Nolen-Hoeksema
et al. (1999) also propose that women experience more
chronic strains, often have a weaker sense of mastery
than men, and tend to ruminate over problems. As
rumination has been shown to mediate the effect of
chronic strains and mastery on depression, women are
subsequently more vulnerable because of these differ-
ent coping strategies. The finding that the sex
difference in depression is mediated by a more dys-
functional repertoire of coping styles among women
has been replicated (Hanninen & Aro, 1996). Twin
analyses have demonstrated sex differences in the heri-
tability and shared environmental impact of coping
strategies (Kato & Pedersen, 2004). Thus, one expla-
nation for the sex difference in heritability of resilience

1 The genetic contribution is only moderately different
for men and women for two of these six factors; per-
sonal growth (h2
women
= .43; h2
men
= .33) and purpose in
life (h2
women
= .39; h2
men
= .19) are both shown to be sig-
nificantly higher among women compared to men.
2 We imputed race for 115 individuals by using the
twin's identified race. We further set 13 pairs to
missing because the twins were discordant on reported
race. The following pairs were dropped: Missing (44),
Black (36), Native American (4), Other (5).
3 It is common to use zygosity values of 1 for MZ pairs
and .5 for DZ pairs because MZ pairs share 100
percent and, on average, DZ pairs share 50 percent of
their genes. However, the use of 0 for DZ makes the
interpretation of the intercept more meaningful as it
pertains to DZ pairs rather than pairs who share 0
percent of their genes.
4 While the reduction in the heritability estimate is not
statistically significant among men, this same reduc-
tion was significant among women (p < .10, one-tail).
5 We also use a bivariate Cholesky decomposition
model to the data to demonstrate whether comparable
results are demonstrated using a variance components
model as with the DF analyses. The results of these
analyses are presented in the appendix and confirm
the finding that the heritability of resilience is stronger
among men compared to women.

while controlling for psychological functioning is the
possibility that women experience normative pressure
to cope with stressors in a maladaptive manner.
There are important limitations that should be
considered when interpreting these results. First,
although we adjust for the nonlinear association with
age, there is a wide range of ages in the study. This is
important because of differential genetic effects across
the life course (Vaupel et al., 1998) but also because of
clear cohort differences in genetic associations (Carey
et al., 1992). For example, Kendler et al. (2000) esti-
mate the heritability of tobacco use by comparing
regular tobacco use among twin pairs raised together
and those raised apart across the following three
cohorts: 1910­1924, 1925­1939, or 1940­1958.
They present a consistent estimate for men across
birth cohorts (h2 ~ .55), but they show that the esti-
mate for women increases over time; the heritability
for the first cohort was zero, but increased to 21%,
and peaked at 64% in the third cohort. Thus, by the
third cohort, there were no sex differences in the heri-
tability of regular tobacco use. The authors argue that
the social restrictions on women's tobacco use have
relaxed significantly across these three cohorts, which
made it possible for genetic tendencies for tobacco use
to manifest. With respect to our study, we are not able
to differentiate between age, period, or cohort effects,
and our results should be considered generalizable to
this adult population only. Second, our focus is on the
parameter estimate for heritability, and we do not
explore sex differences in environmental factors in
further detail. For example, shared environmental influ-
ences are indicated by the coefficients for the twin's
score (t2) in the models of Table 3. There appears to be
a shared environmental effect for women, but not men.
This shared environment may reflect the degree to
which female twins grow up in traditional versus non-
traditional households. Again, given that the sample
ranges in age from 25 to 74, the significant coefficient
for shared environment in model 6 is noteworthy.
Despite these limitations, this paper makes an impor-
tant contribution because we position biological sex as
an environmental moderator. This perspective is impor-
tant because behavioral genetic studies often report sex
differences in heritability, linkage, or associations, but do
not anticipate these differences with a priori hypotheses
about the presence or direction of these differences.
Given the long standing work in the social sciences
regarding the role of sex in terms of identity, structure,
and agency (Collins, 2000), in conjunction with consis-
tent differences in heritability for men and women across
a wide range of different outcomes (Read et al., 2006),
efforts should be made to develop a testable and general-
izable theory regarding the role of sex in behavioral
genetic studies among humans.

Appendix B
The bivariate Cholesky Decomposition model partitions the variance of both phenotypes (we use a continuous
measure of strain using principle components analysis with STATA 9.0. A 1-factor solution was calculated for men
and women separately (r
men
= .14; r
women
= .16) into that due to genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared environ-
mental (with error) variance. Furthermore, the model enables us to decompose the covariance between the two
variables into the same variance components.
Consequently, it is also possible to determine the extent to which the genetic and environmental variance of
resilience is shared in common with the strain variable, and the extent to which they are unique to resilience. This is a
similar analysis to that shown in the DF analysis. For instance, if the genetic influence on resilience decreases after
inclusion of the risk variables, it implies that some of the genetic risk for resilience is accounted for by its association
with the included variables. However, if such a reduction does not occur, we would assume that the genetic risk for
resilience is not shared with the risk variables.
The fit of the full model was compared with that obtained from saturated model in which there are no constraints
and all possible parameters (means, variances, and covariances) are estimated. These descriptive models fit the data
perfectly, serving as a comparative model for nested models. We determine how well the full model explains the
observed data by comparing minus twice the log-likelihood (­2ll) fit and degrees of freedom (df) of the full model
with the saturated model produces a 2 statistic. A low, nonsignificant 2 statistic indicates that the bivariate Cholesky
Decomposition model explains the observed data well and does not violate the assumptions of model fitting (e.g.,
MZ and DZ variances do not differ significantly).
Comparison of the full bivariate (­2ll = 5444.984, df = 2086) and the saturated model (­2ll = 5399.352, df = 2052)
resulted in a 2 fit of the full bivariate model of 45.632, and difference in df of 34; therefore, p = .088, the 2 is non-
significant and out bivariate Cholesky decomposition model fits the observed data well. The resulting standardized
path coefficients for males and females are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. Using the rules of path
analysis, the contribution of each variance component to each of the 2 variables was estimated by squaring the path
coefficients. For males, A
1
(the genetic variance shared in common with the strain variable) contributes 5% of the
total variance of resilience, and A
2
(the genetic variance unique to resilience) contributes 27% of the total variance of
resilience. Thus, of the total genetic variance for resilience (.32), 84% is unique to resilience. This is similar to the
results from the DF analyses for females, in which we demonstrated that inclusion of the risk variables decreased the
genetic effect on resilience, because some of the genetic risk was accounted for by the risks. Therefore, the results of
fitting variance components demonstrate comparable findings to those of the DF model.
