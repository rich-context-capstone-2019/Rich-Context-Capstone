Weight of the Obesity Epidemic
Rising Stroke Rates Among Middle-Aged Women in the United States
Amytis Towfighi, MD; Ling Zheng, PhD; Bruce Ovbiagele, MD
Background and Purpose--Recent US nationally representative data revealed that among individuals aged 45 to 54 years,
women's stroke prevalence was double that of men's. The purpose of this study was to determine if the sex disparity
existed previously.
Methods--We assessed sex-specific stroke and vascular risk factor prevalence among individuals aged 35 to 64 years who
participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), a cross-sectional, nationally
representative survey conducted in 2 waves: 1988 to 1994 (n7234) and 1999 to 2004 (n6499).
Results--Women aged 35 to 54 years who participated in NHANES from 1999 to 2004 were 3 times more likely to have
experienced a stroke compared with similarly aged women in NHANES 1988 to 1994 (1.8% versus 0.6%, P0.003),
but stroke prevalence among men did not change (0.9% versus 1.0%, nonsignificant). Among women, the prevalence
of obesity (15.2% versus 17.9%, P0.08), morbid obesity (12.8% versus 17.5%, P0.003), abdominal obesity (47.4%
versus 58.9%, P0.0001), hypertriglyceridemia (22.91% versus 26.78%, P0.035), and hypertension (33.04% versus
37.43%, P0.03) was lower in NHANES 1988 to 1994 compared with the more recent NHANES wave. Higher waist
circumference was the only independent stroke risk factor for women aged 35 to 54 years in NHANES 1999 to 2004
(OR per 15-cm increase in waist circumference1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.04).
Conclusions--Stroke prevalence among women aged 35 to 54 years has tripled over the past 2 decades, at the same time
remaining stable among men. Prevalence of obesity and 3 metabolic syndrome components increased; they may be key
factors in the increase in women's stroke prevalence. (Stroke. 2010;41:1371-1375.)

An analysis of US stroke prevalence rates from 1999 to
2004 revealed that women aged 45 to 54 years were
more than twice as likely as similarly aged men to report
having experienced a stroke.1 It is unclear whether this sex
disparity in stroke prevalence is new or if it existed previ-
ously. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the
recently noted sex disparity in midlife stroke prevalence was
a new phenomenon. If indeed new, we intended to explore
potential reasons for this recent rise in women's stroke
prevalence by determining: (1) independent predictors of
stroke; and (2) temporal trends in vascular risk factors, key
physical and laboratory measurements, and medication use.
Methods
Overall Design and Study Population
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
are cross-sectional samples of the US civilian noninstitutionalized
population conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.
NHANES analyzed were conducted from 1988 to 1994 in 2 phases
and from 1999 to 2004 in 3 phases; the data from the 2 phases and
3 phases, respectively, were combined following National Center for
Health Statistics recommendations.2,3 The National Center for
Health Statistics Institutional Review Board approved all protocols
for conduct and informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants.4,5 The sampling plan followed a complex, stratified, multi-
stage, probability cluster design with oversampling of non-Hispanic
blacks, Mexican Americans, and the elderly to enhance the precision
of prevalence estimates in those groups.
Interviews collected demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and
health-related information. Mobile examinations consisted of medi-
cal and dental examinations, physiological measurements, and lab-
oratory tests. Details of the survey design and examination proce-
dures have been previously published.4,5
The respective participation rates for the questionnaire and exam-
ination components were 86% and 78% for NHANES 1988 to 1994,
82% and 76% for 1999 to 2000, 84% and 80% for 2001 to 2002, and
79% and 76% for 2003 to 2004. The numbers examined were 30 818
persons in NHANES 1988 to 1994 and 29 402 persons in NHANES
1999 to 2004. Our analysis was limited to individuals aged 35 to 64
years who answered the question regarding prior physician diagnosis
of stroke (n7234 for NHANES 1988 to 1994 and n6499 for
NHANES 1999 to 2004).
Primary Predictor Variable
Stroke history was determined by self-reported history of a physician
diagnosis of stroke.
Covariates
Covariates included cardiovascular, hematologic, lifestyle, and so-
ciodemographic variables known to be associated with stroke.

Categorical variables included sex, age, race/ethnicity, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, history of smoking, history of myocardial infarc-
tion, current atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, elevated low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) level, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) level, abdominal obesity, obesity, history
of cocaine use, history of oral contraceptive pill use, history of
hormone replacement therapy, elevated homocysteine level, and
metabolic syndrome. Continuous covariates included waist circum-
ference, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, and levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-
stimulating hormone, glycosylated hemoglobin, and homocysteine.
Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity (categorized as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other), medical
history, and medication use was determined by self-report. Smoking
was defined by self-reported history of smoking 100 cigarettes.
History of myocardial infarction was defined by self-reported phy-
sician diagnosis. Current atrial fibrillation was defined by detection
of an "irregular pulse" on examination. Hypercholesterolemia was
defined by a self-reported physician diagnosis, self-reported current
medical therapy, or total cholesterol level 200 mg/dL. Elevated
LDL was defined as LDL level 100 mg/dL. BMI was calculated
from height and weight (kg/m2) measured using standardized exam-
ination protocols. Overweight was defined as BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2,
obesity was defined as BMI 30.0 to 35.0 kg/m2, and morbid obesity
was defined as BMI 35 kg/m2. Elevated homocysteine was defined
as homocysteine level 8.5 mol/L. Metabolic syndrome was
defined by the presence of 3 factors: (1) abdominal obesity (waist
circumference 88 cm); (2) hypertriglyceridemia (150 mg/dL or
use of fibrates or niacin); (3) low HDL (50 mg/dL or use of fibrates
or niacin); (4) hypertension (mean of first 3 blood pressure readings
130/85 mm Hg, a self-reported physician diagnosis, or self-
reported current medical therapy); and (5) insulin resistance (self-
reported physician diagnosis, self-reported current medical therapy
[insulin or oral agents], or glycosylated hemoglobin level 6.0%).
This definition differs from the modified Adult Treatment Panel III
definition with respect to insulin resistance classification.6 Our sample
had a large number of missing fasting serum samples precluding use of
fasting glucose; therefore, we used glycosylated hemoglobin, a better
index of overall glycemic exposure and risk for long-term complications
than fasting glucose levels.7 Currently, the recommended glycosylated
hemoglobin cut point for a diabetes mellitus diagnosis is a level
6.5%.7 Individuals with a level ranging from 6.0% to 6.5% are
considered at high risk for developing diabetes mellitus and have been
found to have evidence of end-organ damage7; therefore, a cutoff of
6.0% was chosen for insulin resistance.
Multivariable Models
Tests based on the correlation matrix were conducted to rule out
collinearity before running the multivariable logistic regression analysis.
The following variables were excluded from the model due to the large
number of missing variables: LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, homocysteine,
luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Subjects who
identified their race as "other" were excluded because none had strokes.
Statistical Analysis
Sample weights and the stratification and clustering of the design
were incorporated into our analyses to get proper estimates and SEs
of estimates.2,3 Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression anal-
yses were performed to evaluate predictors of whether the person had
experienced a stroke. The primary reported statistics are the esti-
mated ORs. All data analyses were conducted using SAS (Version
9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistical hypotheses were tested
using P0.05 as the level of significance.
Results
The demographics of the study populations were similar in
the 2 NHANES waves (Table 1). Table 2 shows age- and
sex-specific stroke prevalence. During NHANES 1988 to
1994, there were no sex differences in stroke prevalence
among individuals aged 35 to 44, 45 to 54, or 55 to 64 years.
During NHANES 1999 to 2004, however, a sex disparity
emerged among 45 to 54 year olds (1.04% among men versus
2.45% among women, P0.0038). Comparing stroke preva-
lence across NHANES waves revealed that women aged 35
to 44 years in the latter NHANES wave were 3 times as
likely as women in the previous wave to report a previous
stroke (1.16% versus 0.35%, P0.044), and women aged 45
to 54 were more than twice as likely as those in the previous
wave to report a previous stroke (2.45% versus 1.08%,
P0.062). Among men, however, there was no significant
difference in stroke prevalence for each age group.
Merging the 35- to 44-year and 45- to 54-year age groups
revealed that among 35 to 54 year olds, there was no midlife sex
disparity prevalent stroke in NHANES 1988 to 1994 (0.6% [SE
0.2%] of 2784 women versus 0.9% [SE 0.2%] of 2328 men,
P0.35), but in NHANES 1999 to 2004, women were almost
twice as likely as men to report prevalent stroke (1.8% [SE 0.3]
of 2360 women versus 1.0% [SE 0.2%] of 2231 men, P0.01).
The tripling of stroke prevalence among women aged 35 to 54
years (1.8% versus 0.6%, P0.003), in the setting of stable stroke
prevalence rates among similarly aged men, thus accounted for the
observed sex disparity in midlife stroke prevalence.
Comparison of vascular risk factors across NHANES waves
revealed that women aged 35 to 54 years in the more recent
wave were more likely to have hypertension (37.43% versus
33.04%, P0.03), hypertriglyceridemia (26.78% versus
22.91%, P0.035), abdominal obesity (58.89% versus 47.36%,
P0.0001), obesity (17.9% versus 15.2%, P0.08), morbid
obesity (17.5% versus 12.8%, P0.003), and atrial fibrillation
(2.0% versus 0.87%, P0.0062) than a decade prior. They were
more likely to take medications for hypertension (14.8% versus
8.9%, P0.0001) and dyslipidemia (3.8% versus 1.4%,

therapy (23.1% versus 46.5%, P0.0001). Comparison of an-
thropometric and laboratory values revealed that women in the
more recent NHANES wave had higher mean waist circumfer-
ence (93.6 cm versus 89.7 cm, P0.0001), BMI (28.7 kg/m2
versus 27.2 kg/m2, P0.0001), glycosylated hemoglobin (5.4%
versus 5.3%, P0.0419), HDL (57.0 mg/dL versus 55.1 mg/dL,
P0.0123), and luteinizing hormone (17.9 IU/L versus 10.3
IU/L, P0.0001) levels and lower homocysteine (7.7 mol/L
versus 8.5 mol/L, P0.0002) levels compared with women
a decade prior (Table 3). Although the prevalence of meta-
bolic syndrome did not change, women in the more recent
study were more likely to have 3 components of metabolic
syndrome (abdominal obesity, hypertension, and hypertri-
glyceridemia; Table 3).
Numerous factors increased the odds of previous stroke on
bivariate analysis (Supplemental Table I; available at http://
stroke.ahajournals.org). After adjusting for confounders, in-
crease in age (per 5-year increase OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to
1.28), black non-Hispanic race/ethnicity (OR 4.22, 95% CI 1.19
to 14.94), history of myocardial infarction (OR 7.73, 95% CI
1.16 to 51.67), history of smoking (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.36 to
20.37), and increase in total cholesterol level (per 40-mg/dL
increase OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03) were independently
associated with stroke among women aged 35 to 54 years in the
first NHANES wave, but waist circumference (per 15-cm
increase OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.04) was the only indepen-
dent risk factor for stroke among women aged 35 to 54 years in
the more recent NHANES wave (Table 4).
Discussion
The prevalence of stroke among US women aged 35 to 54 years
has tripled over the 2 most recent decades, whereas prevalence
among similarly aged men has remained stable. Women aged 35
to 54 years are now almost twice as likely to report having had
a stroke compared with men. Whether comparing women across
epochs or with their similarly aged male counterparts, it certainly
appears that the previously reported recent surge in nationwide
stroke prevalence rates among women in this age group is
indeed a new phenomenon.1
Women aged 35 to 54 years are more likely to be obese and
morbidly obese than in the previous decade. Not surprisingly,
key components of the metabolic syndrome (abdominal
obesity, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia) have be-
come more prevalent among women aged 35 to 54 years.
Blood pressure levels and lipid profiles were better among
women who participated in the most recent NHANES wave,
perhaps as a result of increased use of antihypertensive and
lipid-lowering medications. On the other hand, the lack of any
changes in use of medications for diabetes mellitus, in the setting
of an increase in abdominal and general obesity, was associated
with higher glycosylated hemoglobin levels. In addition, women
in the most recent NHANES wave had higher luteinizing
hormone levels, perhaps due to the increase in obesity, which is
associated with polycystic ovary syndrome.8 The improved
homocysteine levels may be a consequence of folic acid fortifica-
tion of enriched grain products, which became mandatory in 1998.
Although several vascular risk factors were independently
associated with prevalent stroke among women aged 35 to 54
years who participated in NHANES 1988 to 1994, higher
waist circumference was the only risk factor independently
associated with prevalent stroke among midlife women who
participated in NHANES 1999 to 2004. This result may lend
support to our hypothesis that the increase in stroke preva-
lence among women aged 35 to 54 years may be related to
worsening national obesity rates differentially and adversely
affecting women at midlife.1 Of course, one cannot make

causal associations in a cross-sectional study and future
prospective studies are necessary.
This study has several limitations. First, NHANES relies
on self-report of medical history, including history of stroke.
Although NHANES has not validated self-reporting of stroke,
previous studies have shown a sensitivity ranging from 80%
to 95% and specificity ranging from 96% to 99%.9,10 Al-
though enhanced media attention and stroke education may
have resulted in more women than men reporting strokes, we
are unaware of such a recent sex disparity in stroke reporting.
Second, because NHANES does not assess incidence, it is not
possible to determine if the changes in prevalence were due to
changes in incidence or survival. However, data from the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention WONDER
(Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research)
database revealed that from 1999 to 2003, there were no sex
differences in stroke mortality in individuals younger than age
45 years, suggesting that the differences observed in prevalence
were due to changes in incidence.11 Supporting this theory, the
Greater Cincinnati­Northern Kentucky Stroke Study found
that at age 35 years, women had higher stroke incidence
than men.12 Third, a substantial proportion of stroke survivors
may have severe disabilities necessitating nursing home place-
ment, thus precluding their participation in NHANES.13 How-
ever, it is unlikely that there were significant differences in the
numbers of individuals discharged to long-term care after

strokes in the 2 NHANES waves. In addition, women are more
likely than men to be discharged to nursing homes and long-term
care14; therefore, women with stroke are less likely to be
captured by NHANES. Fourth, the prevalence of stroke in this
age group was low, limiting the precision of estimates. Fifth, this
study was cross-sectional; because both risk factors and preva-
lent stroke were assessed simultaneously, it is not possible to
ascertain whether the risk factors preceded the stroke. Sixth,
NHANES does not classify ischemic stroke subtype or differ-
entiate hemorrhagic from ischemic strokes. Given the higher
prevalence of atrial fibrillation among women aged 35 to 54
years in the most recent NHANES wave, stroke subtype classi-
fication would have been helpful. Although ischemic stroke,
intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage have
different risk factors, most strokes are presumably ischemic
given the epidemiological breakdown of strokes. Finally, there
were a large number of missing data for certain variables (such
as LDL cholesterol, homocysteine, follicle-stimulating hormone,
luteinizing hormone, triglyceride level, and hormone replace-
ment therapy). Nevertheless, a strength of the study is the
inclusion of a multitude of covariates (incorporating medical
history, biomarkers, and medication use) and rigorous standard-
ized biomarker assessment by trained staff within NHANES.
This study has several implications. First, it challenges the
traditional thinking that men aged 35 to 54 years have a similar
or higher stroke prevalence compared with their female coun-
terparts. Although there are limited data on sex- and age-specific
stroke prevalence rates, the REGARDS (REasons for Geo-
graphic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study,15 which is not
nationally representative, found that fewer women than men
have prevalent stroke at age 45 to 54 years.11 Second, it
corroborates other studies revealing a concerning trend of
increasing prevalence of obesity among adults, including midlife
women.16 Finally, it shows that despite improvements in vascu-
lar risk factor control, stroke prevalence has increased in midlife
women. Perhaps a key to curbing this trend is to focus on
mitigating the growing obesity epidemic. Nationally representa-
tive longitudinal studies are warranted to determine if the
apparent increase in stroke prevalence among women aged 35 to
54 years is due to an increase in incident strokes among young
and middle-aged women.
